**Project Description**

This is a responsive social media web page made with only HTML5 & CSS3 (for now!). It was a project aimed at combining all past CSS knowledge learned in my TripleTen courses thus far, as well as structure BEM blocks appropriately and ensure clean HTML pracitces.

**Project Improvements**

Although it is currently a responsive webpage, it is not exactly a 'social' webpage since users cannot engage with the social media posts currently on the page. I imagine adding some sort of interaction with the like button and profile edit buttons would enhance the page more.

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

**Images**

Exported images directly from Figma â€” recommended as that is how the work world will operate.
